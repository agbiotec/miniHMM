Plan for construction of "Sorcerer's Apprentice" tool webpage


INPUTS:
	Path to hmm seed file (in msf format  -- may need a format converter for eventual public release?)
paste box
browse button

Trusted cutoff value

Path to (and/or choose from drop down) target database for calibration
	Default: NIAA

Choose segmentation method (drop-down)
C-term & N-term pairs
Tiling models
Also need a select box for the tiling overlap parameter for this one

Choose model length
drop down with pre-sets and manual input box
24 amino-acid (for 100bp 454 data)
50 amino-acid (for 200-250 bp 454 data)
100 amino-acid (for single-read ABI data)

Output file directory

OUTPUTS:
	For each mini-model:
HMM file
SEED file
Htab output file
Summary calibration file with cutoffs for each specificity level and the corresponding observed sensitivity

Graphical view of conservation over length of original model and sensitivity at a given specificity for each of the tiling models




METHOD:
	
1)Read in SEED msf file
2)Gap filter
3)Parse into 

NOTE: Is there a way to track and record where each mini model maps to the original full-length seed

NOTE: Hits to the original full-length model above trusted cutoff BUT fragmentary, should be ignored for calibration purposes.
