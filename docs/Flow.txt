1. Submit Form:
        - Inputs
            - Seed File (MSF format)
            - Trusted Cutoff
            - Calibration Target Database (select or filename)
            - Segmentation Method (c/n-term, tiling)
            - Tiling Overlap
            - Model Length (select or manual)
2. Start Session
3. User at Wait/Status page:
    - In background:
        1. Set up run
            - Create Temp directory
            - Save params in session
            - Save Seed file
        2. Trim Seed file of 'gappy' segments (< 65% w/ segments) and save locations of trim
        3. Generate mini-models from trimmed Seed file
            - Tiling
                1. Starting at 0 and walking towards N (step Length - Overlap)
                2. Save mini-msf models of length Length
                3. For the final mini-model, if it is not full length, elongate back to make it so
            - C-/N-term
                1. ???
        4. For each mini-model and on the seed (on-grid, if possible)
            1. build HMM (/usr/local/bin/hmmbuild --amino -F $hmm_out $model)
            2. calibrate HMM (/usr/local/bin/hmmcalibrate --num 1000 $hmm_out)
            3. perform HMM search against Calibration Database (/usr/local/bin/hmmsearch $hmm_out $db)
        5. Calculate hit profile for seed at trusted cutoff
        6. For each mini-model
            1. calculate cutoff and sensitivity for specificities of (100, 95, 90, 85 %) (specificity = 1 - % mini hits not in profile. sensitivity is % of hits in profile also in mini)
4. User at results page:
    - chart of models w/ sens/spec numbers
    - graph of sens/spec for mini-models along length of seed model (make sure to account for gapped regions, throw out models across gap(?))
    - allow download of zipped results
